\begin{abstract}
A generalized variable-coefficient Sasa-Satsuma-like equation which can describe the ultra short pulses in optical fiber communications and propagation of deep ocean waves is investigated in this Letter. With symbolic computation help, Lax pair and Riccati-type auto-B\"acklund transformation are constructed. Based on the result, the explicit one-soliton solutions is obtained and an infinite number of conservation laws are derived recursively. In additionally, exact explicit rogue wave solution is presented by use of a Darboux transformation under certain conditions. \\

\section{Introduction}
Sasa-Satsuma equation (SSE) is one of the nonlinear evolution equations (NLEEs), which has attracted much attentions and studied in recent years. It is used to describe and explain many phenomenons in different fields such as fluid dynamics, plasma physics, and optical fiber communications. When under different conditions or complex scenes, the variable-coefficient NLEEs are able to describe various situations more realistically than their constant-coefÔ¨Åcient counterparts. In this Letter we will investigate a generalized and expanded Sasa-Satsuma equation with variable coefficients as follows,
\begin{align}
  & \mathrm{i}u_{t} + a_{1}(t)u_{xx} + a_2(t)|u|^{2}u + a_3(t)\mathrm{i}u_{xxx} + a_{4}(t)\mathrm{i}(|u|^{2}u)_{x} + a_{5}(t)\mathrm{i}(|u|^{2})_{x}u + a_{6}(t)u \notag\\
  & + a_{7}(t)\mathrm{i}u_{x}=0,
\end{align}
where $u$ denotes the complex envelope of the wave field, and all coefficients $a_{1}(t), \cdots, a_{6}(t)$ are real functions of $t$, describing the effects of group velocity dispersion, self-phase modulation, third order dispersion, self-steepening and self-frequency shifting via stimulated Raman scattering respectively.

This Letter is arranged as follows. In Section 2, based on the extended AKNS system, the Lax pair of Eq.(1) will be constructed. In Section 3, Riccati-type auto-B\"acklund transformations will be presented and then one-soliton of Eq.(1) will be provided via the obtained B\"acklund transformation. And an infinite number of recursive conservation laws will be derived in Section 4. In Section 5, A twisted rogue-wave pair will be given under certain constraints. Finally, we will get conclusion and discussion in Section 6.

\section{Lax Pair}
    The Lax pair may ensure the complete integrability of a NLEE, and can be used to obtain B\"acklund transformation, soliton solutions and conservation laws. To construct the Lax pair of Eq.(1), we extend AKNS procedure and introduce the function $a(t)$ and $b(t)$ as below,
\begin{align}
  & \Phi_{x} = U\Phi = a(t)(\lambda U_{0} + U_{1})\Phi \\
  & \Phi_{t} = V\Phi = b(t)(\lambda^{3}V_{0} + \lambda^{2}V_{1} + \lambda V_{2} + V_{3})\Phi
\end{align}
where $\Phi=(\Phi_{1}, \Phi_{2}, \Phi_{3})^{T}$, $\lambda$ is a parameter independent of $x$ and $t$, $U$ and $V$ are two $3 \times 3$ matrices, which must satisfy the compatibility condition $U_{t} - V_{x} + UV - VU = 0$.
