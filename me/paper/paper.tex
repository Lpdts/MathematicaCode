\begin{abstract}
A generalized variable-coefficient Sasa-Satsuma-like equation which can describe the ultra short pulses in optical fiber communications and propagation of deep ocean waves is investigated in this Letter. With symbolic computation help, Lax pair and Riccati-type auto-B\"acklund transformation are constructed. Based on the result, the explicit one-soliton solutions is obtained and an infinite number of conservation laws are derived recursively. In additionally, exact explicit rogue wave solution is presented by use of a Darboux transformation under certain conditions. \\

\section{Introduction}
Sasa-Satsuma equation (SSE) is one of the nonlinear evolution equations (NLEEs), which has attracted much attentions and studied in recent years. It is used to describe and explain many phenomenons in different fields such as fluid dynamics, plasma physics, and optical fiber communications.
